    All variables have a datatype.  The 2 primary datatypes are value types and reference types.  Characters, booleans, doubles, floats, and integers all fall within "Value".  Classes fall within "Reference".  
If a value type changes, only that specific variable is affected.  If a reference is affected, all variables that contain the same memory address will be affected.  Value types contain their own copy of data.  
Changing values only affect the specific variable.  When you assign a variable to a class, they have the same memory address, and changing one will change the other.
