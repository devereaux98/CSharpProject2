    The "dot operator" is a period seen between words in code.  Dot operators allow you to access or seperate
elements of a compound item.  Semi-colons are used to terminate statements.  The opening/closing of class 
declarations, functions, and if statements.  Indenting allows for legibility, letting you see the functional 
structure of your code.  Comments are also tools used in organizing and reading code.  Comments can also be 
used for temporarily disabling a portion of code.
