    An "if statement" tests whether or not values and situations are ideal to run certain functions or call them.  
An "else statement" performs a task when the "if statement" returns as false.  Adding an "if" to the "else statement" 
will cause it to become a conditional.  An "if statement" helps your code make a decision as to what it should do.
An if statement is handy to use when the code requires user input.  If the user inputs a certain value, a certain task will 
be performed.  Likewise with other values included within the "else if statements".  If the user inputs none of these things,
the functions contained in the "else statement" will run.
