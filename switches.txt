    A switch statement is a conditional that is used to compare a single variable to a series of constants.  Common use for switches is to make decisions alongside Enumerations. 
 Switches function similarly to if statements, but can be used to make the code much less convoluted and short.  A switch's syntaz looks like this: switch (variable){}.  Within
 the curly braces we use cases, or constants that are compared against our variable.  A case's syntax looks like this: case 1:.  What follows the declaration of the case is What
 the case performs when it is true.  In order to finish the case, we have to use a jump statement, the most commonly used is "break;".  In order to perform an action that happens
 when none of the cases are true, we use the keyword "default".  Defaults must have "break;" at the end just like cases.  Defaults can be compared to else statements.
