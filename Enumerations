    Enums are data types that have specific subsets with possible values.  Enums can be made inside or outside of classes, depending on what classes and codes need to access them.  
An Enum's syntax is as follows:  enum EName {var1, var2, var3, var4};.  The constants within the enum have a default value of an integer equaling zero, which is incremented throughout 
the set (so order matters when creating enums).  It is possible to change the type of an enum (other than integer) by putting a colon after the name, and putting a type.  To make a
variable from the enum, you say the name of the enum, followed by the name of the variable (EName varName;).  To set the variable equal to one of the enum values, you type in 
varName = EName.var; (var being whichever value you need).  To make a function with an enum, you type EName FunctionName (EName FunctionParam).
